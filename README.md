# Wootlab-Moovie-App-
Okwechime Ikechukwu movie User Interface Design Submission 

#BRIEF DESCRIPTION 

The Moovie App was born out of the need to get regular upodates to new movies as they are released.

The Moovie app enables the user watch movie trailers.

The App gives the user th freedom to update a watchlist of the Trailers watched and reorganizs it as at when needed.

#REASONING BEHIND THE DESIGN CHOICES 

a-  I created a bold landing page that contains 10 movies which will fill up the mobile screen and has the capabilty of drawing the
    user to click on any of the movies in th listing.

b-  The fact that every user has to be registered before he can access the movie trailers gave th need for multiple modes to login 
    hence, facebook, twitter and instagram login options.

c-  The major task was to make sure user was able to manage his watchlist (Favourite page) at will, so i created multiple connections 
    in accessing the page.
    
    
#ISSUES

a-  It's tasking fitting 10 movies on a page in an android page of 360px X 640px ( 9 movies would have worked just fine thereby 
    giving room to create categories without creating clusters.)

b-  Due to the fact that there was no spcific device size given, I built the moovie app with a basic standard android size which may not appear 
    properly on devices that are longer in size i.e Samsung Galaxy 9 or iPhone 11.
